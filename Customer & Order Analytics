--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data

--Q1: How many orders were placed in January? = 9681
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--Q2: How many of those orders were for an iPhone? = 379
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderid) = 6


--Q3: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT FebSales.orderID, customers.order_id, customers.acctnum
FROM customers
JOIN FebSales ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.orderID <> ''
AND FebSales.orderID <> 'Order ID'


--Q4:Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? = AAA Batteries 4-pack
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1


--Q5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*Price) as Revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product

--Q6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(Quantity),product,sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product


--Q7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
